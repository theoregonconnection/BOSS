Many people use Excel (or similar spreadsheet software) to organize their data. The purpose of this project is to build a software solution that makes it easy to analyze, visualize and share these data sets. This software is designed with biomedical science (cancer research, in particular) in mind, but it can be adapted for a wide variety of applications.
